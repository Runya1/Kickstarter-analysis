# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project was about play Fever fundraising campaigns created by Louiseâ€™s.
 Louise want to know whether her crowd funding project was successful in relation to launch dates 
and whether the campaign attained the funding goals.
The project was visualized using pivot table and line charts in excel.


First data was imported into a table for analysis.
Filters, conditional formatting, and formulas were used to generate pivot tables and line charts.
 Excel analysis with visualizations was performed followed by nterpretation of the visualized figures.


### Purpose

The fundraising campaign estimated at $10,000 termed as fever aimed to mirror successful business 
campaigns which was done through visualizing business outcomes successes on launch dates and set goals
It was conducted to assist Loise to determine the timing of her fundraising goal for a play after falling short of her fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was done in excel to develp pivot tables and line charts to visualize business outcomes based on launc dates.
The challenge I encountered, was that the formulas were overwhelming at fisrst but as the visualizations became clear, 
I was delighted to see the results.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the Chart theater outcomes based on launch date, the following observations were made.
The successful campaign per month was achieved in the month of May, 111 was the highest pick for the theater campaign.
 The canceled campaigns remained low throughout the year, while at the end of the year (Dec) both the successful 
and failed campaigns were meeting at the same point (40%).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

From the Chart outcome vs goals, the following observations were made.
For Successful outcomes, set at less than 1000 goal, the outcomes based on goals were successful at 70%,
 the trend remained on a downward trend finishing at less than 20% for goal amount set at 50,000 or more. 
The failed percentage at less than 1000 goal was slightly above 20% and it continued an upward trend, finishing slightly below 60%.
The canceled outcomes remained low and finished at slightly above 20%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  Some of the formulas were difficult to apply, they were updated manually, especially ranges were being calculated.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

May and June will be the best month for theater campaign launch date.
December is the least month to launch theater campaign.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

From the results, Loise need to revist her goals to less than $10,000 amount where she can raise more funds.
In addition, most successses will be realised at $5000 0r less.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is limited to make conclusions on, for example,the outcome of canceled is based on only 37 variables.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Calculating additional fields might help has make conclusive statements on goals and outcomes.
